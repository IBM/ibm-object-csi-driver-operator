# ibm-object-csi-driver-operator
A CSI based object storage plugin with dynamic bucket provisioning and plugable mounters, like rclone, s3fs and other. The plugin should seamlessly work in IBM, AWS and GCP platforms.

## Description
ibm-object-csi-driver-operator is a user defined storage controller extending K8S capability to manage COS Buckets as PV/PVC resource.
This is designed and developed as per CSI specification. It enables the application workloads to dynamically provision volumes backed by COS buckets as per PVC/PV framework. As of now it supports s3fs & rclone mounters to mount the bucket as a fuse FileSystem inside the POD. 

## Getting Started
You’ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<image-registry>/ibm-object-csi-driver-operator:<image-tag>
```

2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<image-registry>/ibm-object-csi-driver-operator:<image-tag>
```

3. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

**Note**: 
- By default, in the IBM Object CSI Driver, the secret name is not tied to the PVC name. This allows you to use a single secret across multiple PVCs. For this, you’ll need to add two specific annotations in the PVC YAML. These annotations help the driver map the PVC to the correct secret.
```
annotations:
    cos.csi.driver/secret: "custom-secret"
    cos.csi.driver/secret-namespace: "default"
```
- If you want to have 1-to-1 mapping between each PVC and secret(using same name for both) i.e., specific secret tied to respective PVC, then you need to create a custom storage class as below and use it to create PVC.
```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: custom-object-csi-storage-class
  labels:
provisioner: cos.s3.csi.ibm.io
mountOptions:
    - "multipart_size=62"
    - "max_dirty_data=51200"
    - "parallel_count=8"
    - "max_stat_cache_size=100000"
    - "retries=5"
    - "kernel_cache"
parameters:
  mounter: <"s3fs" or "rclone">
  client: "awss3"
  cosEndpoint: "https://s3.direct.us-west.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud"
  locationConstraint: "us-west-smart"
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: ${pvc.name}
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: ${pvc.namespace}
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-publish-secret-name: ${pvc.name}
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-publish-secret-namespace: ${pvc.namespace}
reclaimPolicy: <Retain or Delete>
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
