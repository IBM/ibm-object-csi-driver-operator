# ibm-object-csi-driver-operator
A CSI based object storage plugin with dynamic bucket provisioning and plugable mounters, like rclone, goofys, s3fs and other. The plugin should seamlessly work in IBM, AWS and GCP platforms.

## Description
ibm-object-csi-driver-operator is a user defined storage controller extending K8S capability to manage COS Buckets as PV/PVC resource.
This is designed and developed as per CSI specification. It enables the application workloads to dynamically provision volumes backed by COS buckets as per PVC/PV framework. As of now it supports s3fs & rclone mounters to mount the bucket as a fuse FileSystem inside the POD. 

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<image-registry>/ibm-object-csi-driver-operator:<image-tag>
```

2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<image-registry>/ibm-object-csi-driver-operator:<image-tag>
```

3. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```


### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
